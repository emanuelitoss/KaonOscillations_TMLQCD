Added IO for SF gauge configs in lexicographic order
and fixed some features of the data layout for T=L

modules/archive/archive.c
   Renamed import/export_cnfg to import/export_cnfg_cern.
   Added import/export_cnfg_lex.
   Now import/export_cnfg select between the above depending on sf_flg() 
   IO with lexicograpic order can be disabled by undefining the
   CPP macros USE_EXPORT_LEX and/or USE_IMPORT_LEX

modules/uflds/udcom.c
   Added init_bnd_ud needed by import_cnfg_lex.

include/uflds.h
   Added protogype for init_bnd_ud.

modules/lattice/geometry.c
   Changed function index to correctly support cache-blocks 
   with an odd number of sites.

modules/lattice/uidx.c
   Added a warning if negative indices iu0 or iuk occur.

modules/uflds/plaq_sum.c
   Suppressed computation of time-like plaquettes in
   local_plaq_sum_dble if ( (N0&1) && t == N0-1 ) to
   avoid potential access to unallocated memory.
