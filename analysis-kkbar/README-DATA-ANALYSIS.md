# Data Analysis work
This folder contain data analysis of $K^0 - \bar K^0$ oscillations caused by the insertion of a complete set of dimension 6, four quarks operators. The work consists in the analysis of data from lattice QCD simulations.

Brief list of programs:
- <span style="color:orange"> reader2pts.py </span>: it reads data from two points correlators simulation program and plots them. All the data informations are printed.
- <span style="color:orange"> reader3pts.py </span> : it reads data from three points correlators simulation program and plots them. All the data informations are printed.
- <span style="color:orange"> check1.py </span> : it checks the Gauge invariance of the program using the first set of data (pointlike sources).
- <span style="color:orange"> check2.py </span> : it checks the Gauge invariance of the program using the second set of data (noise spinor sources).
