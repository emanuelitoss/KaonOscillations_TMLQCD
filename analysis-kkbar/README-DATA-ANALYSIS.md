# Data Analysis work
This folder contains data analysis of $K^0 - \bar K^0$ oscillations due by the insertion of a complete set of dimension 6, four quarks operators. The work consists in the analysis of data from lattice QCD simulations.

Brief list of programs:
- <span style="color:orange"> reader2_SC.py </span>: it reads data from two points correlators simulation program and plots them. All the data informations are printed. It reads only the first configuration.
- <span style="color:orange"> reader2_MC.py </span>: it reads data from two points correlators simulation program and plots them. All the data informations are printed. It reads alle the first configurations.
- <span style="color:orange"> reader3_SC.py </span> : it reads data from three points correlators simulation program and plots them. All the data informations are printed. It reads only the first configuration.
- <span style="color:orange"> reader3_MC.py </span> : it reads data from three points correlators simulation program and plots them. All the data informations are printed. It reads alle the first configurations.
- <span style="color:orange"> check1.py </span> : it checks the Gauge invariance of the program using the first set of data (pointlike sources). Further infos in the README.checks of the simulation
- <span style="color:orange"> check2.py </span> : it checks the Gauge invariance of the program using the second set of data (noise spinor sources). Further infos in the README.checks of the simulation
- <span style="color:orange"> check3.py </span> : the same of check1.py, this time for the two points functions
- <span style="color:orange"> check4.py </span> : the same of check2.py, this time for the two points functions
