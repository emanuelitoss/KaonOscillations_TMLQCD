# To-Do list of thesis project

## About Code
- read the code: 'meson.c' for two point functions with pure Wilson quarks
- read the code: 'tm_meson.c' for two point functions with twisted mass quarks
- understand very well how to implement the open boundary conditions within the code for three point functions involving 4 quarks dim-6 operators.

## About articles and references
- Schroedinger functional
- Twisted mass
- Open boundary conditions
- O(a) improved Wilson fermions

# Questions and fixed points to improve
- Unphysical zero modes of Wilson fermions and tmQCD: skill yourself
- Open boundary conditions: freezing of topological charge and autocorrelation lengths
