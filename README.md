# KaonOscillations_TMLQCD

This repo contains codes to evaluate Kaon oscillation matrix elements / three points correlation functions;
this is done throught the insertion of a complete set of 4-quarks dimension-6 operators.

Keywords: maximally twisted mass, open boundary conditions, dimesnion 6 operators, beyond the standard model, bag parameters...
